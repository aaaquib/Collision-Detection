\section OpenGLTrainer_Introduction OpenGLTrainer 

OpenGLTrainer is a small library of C++ classes and helper functions 
used in the introductory computer graphics courses taught by Prof. Zachary
Wartell at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  OpenGLTrainer links
against and leverages the following libraries:

	- GLUT - a popular simplistic OpenGL GUI
	- GLEW - a popular API for accessing advanced OpenGL and extensions 
	- FreeImage - an API for reading in a variety of common image files 

Instructions for compiling OpenGLTrainer, these dependent libriares, the example
applications are found in <a href="../OpenGLTrainer Compilation.html"> 
"../OpenGLTrainer Compilation.html" </a>.

Within OpenGLTrainer itself, only those classes whose documentation is exported
into HTML pages are meant for student use.  C++ classes labeled as
'Experimental' or located inside 'Experimental' subdirectories aren't meant to
be used by students.
