Collision detection using modified Bresenham line drawing algorithm

Implemention of a modified version of the Breshenham mid-point based line algorithm to accelerate part of a collision detection computation.

Extend the above algorithm to test for a disc-rectangle intersection using openGL to demonstrate this visually.
